                  <p>This Book First came into being on a rainy night in Tokyo,</p>
                  <p>when its authors sat down together for the first time in one of </p>
                  <p>the city's tiny bars.</p>

                       <p>We had read each other's work but had never met,thanks</p>
                        <p>to the thousands of miles that seperate Barcelona from the </p>
                        <p>capital of Japan. Then a mutual accquaintance put us in touch,</p>
                        <p>launching a friendship that led to this project and seems destined</p>
                        <p>to last a lifetime.</p>

                           <p>The next time we got together, a year later, we strolled</p>
                           <p>through a park in downtown Tokyo and ended up talking</p>
                           <p>about trends in Western psychology, specifically logotherapy,</p>
                           <p>which helps people find their purpose in life.</p>

                          <center>
                              <p>We remarked that Viktor Frankyl's logotherapy had gone</p>
                              <p>out of fashion among practicing therapists,who favoured</p>
                              <p>other schools of psychology,though people still search for</p>
                              <p>meaning in what they do and how they live.We ask ourselves</p>
                              <p>things like:</p>

                                   <p>"What is the meaning of my life?"</p>
                                    <p>"Is the point just to live longer,or should i seek a higher purpose"</p>
                                    <p>Why do some people know what they want and have a </p>
                                    <p>passion for life,while others languish in confusion?</p>
                                    <p>At some point in our conversation, the mysterious word</p>

                                          <p>This Japanese concept,which translates roughly as </p>
                                          <p>"the happiness of always being busy," is like logotherapy,but it</p>
                                          <p>goes a step beyond.It also seems to be one way of explaining </p>
